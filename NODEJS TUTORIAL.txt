HTTPS Methods

1.GET : This request is used to get a resource from a server. If you perform a GET request, the server looks for the data you requested and sends it back to you. In other words, a GET request performs a READ operation. This is the default request method.

2.POST This request is used to create a new resource on a server. If you perform a POST request, the server creates a new entry in the database and tells you whether the creation is successful. In other words, a POST request performs an CREATE operation.

3.PUT and PATCH: These two requests are used to update a resource on a server. If you perform a PUT or PATCH request, the server updates an entry in the database and tells you whether the update is successful. In other words, a PUT or PATCH request performs an UPDATE operation.

4.DELETE : This request is used to delete a resource from a server. If you perform a DELETE request, the server deletes an entry in the database and tells you whether the deletion is successful. In other words, a DELETE request performs a DELETE operation.
